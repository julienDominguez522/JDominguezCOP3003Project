## Inventory Management System
The idea behind this code is setting up an accessible inventory system where a
user can input various items they wish to store and be able to reference, change
and delete those items as desired.
This allows an organized way to keep inventory of the user’s items by utilizing
various functions to reference items with various sizes, quantities and properties
which will be stored as a struct for each item.

## 2nd Development:
Most of my functions are working as they should while there are some obvious areas for polishing and 
corrections. I would like to clean my code up by moving the functions to a header file, just so the
main code is neater and not as overloaded visually. I would like to eventually add structs so I can
get to the point to where my user can establish their own items, making this code more versatile.
I am also still working on figuring out the JSON so I can begin storing the inventory information
where needed.
